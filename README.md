# Blooket pin finder

A bit different than a kahoot finder, instead of making a get request to see if the website with the pin exists, I turn the raw json into a python library to read.


## what is sayit.py?

Sayit.py is a small script I made to quickly type all of the pins in the pin.txt file. Made for something like sending them to a friend or writing them down in another file.
